# Project Voice

Rhythm game clone, WIP

## TODO/Missing Features:
- [x] Exiting a song takes you to result screen
- [x] Rapidly changing Background Blur creates a memory leak (probably not disposing of old blurred image)
- [x] Define how the scoring system will work
- [ ] Save and display High Scores
- [ ] Make Result Screen look decent
- [x] Collection FX looks too fast
- [ ] Properly credit people and document borrowed code
- [ ] Make README
